# Clasificacion animales por distancia

The nearest neighbor algorithm is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm that is used to classify or predict the clustering of an individual data point. This algorithm uses proximity to make classifications or predictions1.Use the nearest neighbor algorithm to classify animals based on their biological characteristics. The algorithm could calculate the proximity between animals using metrics such as Hamming distance and Euclidean distance and then assign a class label to each animal based on its proximity to other animals with similar biological characteristics.
The project includes a folder called "Originales" from where the characteristics of the classified animals and those that are not yet classified are extracted, within the "Distancia Hamming" and "Distancia Euclidiana" folders, the results of the algorithm's classification are found. , depending on which distance algorithm you chose, they look like this ------> ![alt text]( https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/Artificial-Intelligence-Visual-Studio-.NET/blob/main/Distania%20Eucladiana-Hamming%20y%20Triangulo%20suma%209/Clasificacion%20animales%20por%20distancia/Videos/Clasificacion%20animales%20por%20distancia.png?raw=true) 

# Triangulo

This program is designed to solve the triangle sum 9 puzzle, in which you must place the numbers 1 through 6 in the circles of the triangle without repeating numbers, in such a way that each side of the triangle adds up to 9. The initial state is a triangle with no numbers and there are three possible goal states.

To solve the puzzle, the program follows certain preconditions and uses specific operators. Preconditions include not using missing numbers and making sure the number in the corner is less than the number in the center. If the sum of a line exceeds 9 or falls short of 9, the program performs certain operations to adjust the numbers in the corners and in the center.

The operators available to solve the puzzle include marking numbers as available or unavailable and placing numbers at the corners and center of the triangle. The program uses these tools to find a solution to the puzzle and display it to the user.

All the information, as well as desktop tests are inside the folders, check the additional information to better understand how I solved the puzzle with Visual studio and C# I leave you an image of the user interface. ![alt text]( https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/Artificial-Intelligence-Visual-Studio-.NET/blob/main/Distania%20Eucladiana-Hamming%20y%20Triangulo%20suma%209/Triangulo/Triangulo.png?raw=true)
