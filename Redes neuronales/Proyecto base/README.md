# Base project - explanation of the projects

| Amortiguamiento | This project uses an Excel file to extract the coordinates of an equation evaluated over a period of time. The goal is that given a proposed line, we can equalize the original line by comparing it and calculating the mean squared error (MSE). The learning rate determines the damping, that is, the size and stability of the steps taken in each iteration. If the learning rate is too large, the algorithm may skip the minimum or diverge. If the learning rate is too small, the algorithm may take a long time to converge or get stuck in a local minimum. Once the MSE is minimal, we graph both lines. ![alt text]( https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/Artificial-Intelligence-Visual-Studio-.NET/blob/main/Redes%20neuronales/Proyecto%20base/Imagenes/Amortiguamiento.png?raw=true) ![alt text]( https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/Artificial-Intelligence-Visual-Studio-.NET/blob/main/Redes%20neuronales/Proyecto%20base/Imagenes/AmortiguamientoExcel.png?raw=true ) |
| ClasificadorColoresPorNeuronas | This is a program that helps you compare objects by their color, using perceptrons. The color is obtained through an Arduino connected to a TCS3200 color sensor, 3 analog values of the RGB scale of an object’s color. We connect the Arduino to Visual Studio via serial port. An interface is used to collect the entire database and then compare the colors of the objects. Interface. ----> ![alt text]( https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/Artificial-Intelligence-Visual-Studio-.NET/blob/main/Redes%20neuronales/Proyecto%20base/Imagenes/ClasificadorColoresPorNeuronas.png?raw=true ) The interface works as follows. You connect to the port in which the Arduino communicates, once the connection is established, the "Collect Data" button is pressed, 10 samples of the object's color are taken, repeat this with the rest of the buttons, then you assign a name to the color and it is saved, this creates an Excel where the information is stored so that you can also be able to see it, this information is in the folder \Proyecto base\Clasificador ColoresPorNeuronas\bin\Debug, in fact there are several files that you will find, they look like this -----> ![alt text]( https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/Artificial-Intelligence-Visual-Studio-.NET/blob/main/Redes%20neuronales/Proyecto%20base/Imagenes/ClasificadorColoresPorNeuronas-ArchivosExcel.png?raw=true )"ExcelHojaRoja" "ExcelTabla" and "ExcelLibro" are the files that correspond to the database obtained RGB, the name corresponds to the name you use to save the name of the object. The file for any object looks like this ![alt text]( https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/Artificial-Intelligence-Visual-Studio-.NET/blob/main/Redes%20neuronales/Proyecto%20base/Imagenes/ClasificadorColoresPorNeuronas-RGBExcel.png?raw=true ) When saving the color, the excel file of the perceptron is created that contains the training data of the perceptron, these are the ones that it captures for each object, 50 of its own and 50 of another object, always of the objects that you present. Then the "Train Perceptrons" button is pressed, this is the most complex part of the project and you must have a lot of knowledge about the structure of a perceptron and its equations that define it in order to understand the code in depth, however I will give a very detailed version. Summarized what happens, there is a class called a perceptron which contains another class called Neuron, the neuron has all the necessary parameters internally to function, such as synaptic weights, learning coefficient, etc. These data are obtained from Excel "Perceptron training", you can modify them, remember that your data will be the starting point, the neuron will train itself to reach the exact parameters that recognize color. Once the neurons have been created, we proceed to train them, a propagation algorithm is used, which modifies the synaptic weights and the threshold, when evaluating the output of the neuron, this is done 100 times until the neuron is calibrated and makes us a correct estimate of the expected result. Ready, we just make a truth table to know which of the multiple neurons that are created (depending on the number of colors that you want to differentiate) is the one that gives us positive and which color we should choose. All the algorithms were developed by me, the only library that I used was Exodus, which was made by me to work mathematical functions within the math library, with arrangements of the type [] and [,], I recommend analyzing the Code before compiling if you want to better understand its operation since this was a very short summary. The following image shows the final internal result of training the perceptrons, the initial values on the left of the neuron (try to make a kind of XD drawing with cells), on the right the training pattern with 100 elements to evaluate, and a section that marks "Correct Data", which are the final data of the neuron that, if it evaluates correctly, without error. ->>>>>![alt text]( https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/Artificial-Intelligence-Visual-Studio-.NET/blob/main/Redes%20neuronales/Proyecto%20base/Imagenes/ClasificadorColoresPorNeuronas-PerceptronExcel.png?raw=true ) |
| ClasificadorDeColoresPorEstadisticaClasica | It works very similar to the project by neurons, but instead of using perceptrons we use classical statistics, I designed an algorithm, Maximum likelihood estimation, by which, through normal distributions and probabilities, we can distinguish if one color is different from another, this time the data is not saved, they are all calculated in real time, thanks to the Exodus library, the interface is as follows, I suppose if you have read this far you can understand how it works. ![alt text]( https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/Artificial-Intelligence-Visual-Studio-.NET/blob/main/Redes%20neuronales/Proyecto%20base/Imagenes/ClasificadorDeColoresPorEstadisticaClasica.png?raw=true ) |
| ERROR DE Pi | This is a C# algorithm that computes an approximation of the value of π (pi) using an infinite series. The algorithm is executed when the “BtnCalculate” button is clicked. First, the variables pi and divisor are initialized with the values 0 and 1, respectively. The algorithm then enters a for loop that is executed 10,000 times. On each iteration of the loop, the value of 4 divided by the current value of divisor is added to and subtracted from the variable pi. The divisor value is then incremented by 2. After each iteration of the loop, the value of pi is displayed in the txtCalculate text box. Finally, after the loop has finished, the absolute error between the actual value of π and the value calculated by the algorithm is calculated and displayed in the txtError text box. ![alt text]( https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/Artificial-Intelligence-Visual-Studio-.NET/blob/main/Redes%20neuronales/Proyecto%20base/Imagenes/ERROR%20DE%20Pi.png?raw=true) |
| Éxodo | One of the main pieces of the projects is the “Exodo” library, it contains all the necessary methods in a standard “math” library, such as abs, sum, ceiling, cos, sin, etc., the difference is that I I added extra power by being able to receive arrays of the type, [ ], [ , ] as arguments. It also has more sections: functions, gauss, line, and statistics, they are methods that contain all the mathematical-statistical material necessary to manage your database in the form of arrays, and to be able to store them, as well as graph them. You can feel free to extract this library from the project and use it to your advantage in any other project ![alt text]( https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/Artificial-Intelligence-Visual-Studio-.NET/blob/main/Redes%20neuronales/Proyecto%20base/Imagenes/Exodo.png?raw=true) |
| GraficadorSeno | First, the code takes the text in the txtArray text box and splits it into a string array called Arraystring, using the comma as the separator. Then, it creates an array of double numbers called ArrayDouble with the same length as Arraystring. The code then converts each element of StringArray to a double number and adds it to DoubleArray, while adding all the elements together to calculate the mean. The code then creates a list of Data objects and adds an initial object with values of 0 for DataSeries1 and DataInArray, and the previously calculated mean for Meana. The code then retrieves each element in DoubleArray, calculates its sine value multiplied by an incrementing value based on the length of the array, and adds it to the list as a new Data object. Finally, the code cleans up any existing series in chart1, binds the data list to it, and sets the chart types for the two series.  ![alt text]( https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/Artificial-Intelligence-Visual-Studio-.NET/blob/main/Redes%20neuronales/Proyecto%20base/Imagenes/GraficadorSeno.png?raw=true) |
| Media De Un Arreglo | First, the code takes the text in the txtArray text box and splits it into a string array called Arraystring, using the comma as the separator. Then, it creates an array of double numbers called ArrayDouble with the same length as Arraystring. The code then converts each element of StringArray to a double number and adds it to DoubleArray, while adding all the elements together to calculate the mean. The code then creates a list of Data objects and iterates through each element in DoubleArray, adding it to the list as a new Data object with an incrementing index for DataString1, the element value for DataInArray, and the previously computed mean for Meana. Finally, the code cleans up any existing series in chart1, binds the datalist to it, and sets the chart types for the two series to lines. ![alt text](https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/Artificial-Intelligence-Visual-Studio-.NET/blob/main/Redes%20neuronales/Proyecto%20base/Imagenes/Media%20De%20Un%20Arreglo.png?raw=true) |
| NeuronaArtificialMonocapa | This project represents the perceptron class which is a monolayer artificial neuron, basically the main code does the following: Defines the path of an Excel file called trainingPerceptron.xlsx and opens it with the SLDocument class. Create an instance of the Perceptron class using the Excel document and a string "x2vsx4" to name the folder where the data will be stored. Train the perceptron using the TrainPerceptron method, through propagation by modifying synaptic weights and threshold. Save the Excel file using the SaveExcelFile method. The method then repeats the same steps for another Excel file named trainingPerceptron1.xlsx and another instance of the Perceptron class. The interface is just a button and the generated excel file pretends to represent a neuron, they look like this ->>>> ![alt text]( https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/Artificial-Intelligence-Visual-Studio-.NET/blob/main/Redes%20neuronales/Proyecto%20base/Imagenes/NeuronaArtificialMonocapa.png?raw=true ) ![alt text]( https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/Artificial-Intelligence-Visual-Studio-.NET/blob/main/Redes%20neuronales/Proyecto%20base/Imagenes/NeuronaArtificialMonocapa%201.png?raw=true )  Remember that these files are stored in \Proyecto base\NeuronaArtificialMonocapa\bin\Debug |
| PerceptronMulticapaNumeros | The method creates an instance of a multi-layered class called "Perceptron" and trains it on a set of input and output data. In the code, the perceptron is trained on a set of input and output data to learn how to classify the data. The perceptron is trained for 8000 iterations and information is displayed on the console every 500 iterations. The information provided by the console and the interface button are shown below, consider that only up to 2000 iterations are shown, this is to better capture the data in the image, and also because from iteration 1500, the neural network classifies well on all occasions. ![alt text]( https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/Artificial-Intelligence-Visual-Studio-.NET/blob/main/Redes%20neuronales/Proyecto%20base/Imagenes/PerceptronMulticapaNumeros.png?raw=true) ![alt text](  https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/Artificial-Intelligence-Visual-Studio-.NET/blob/main/Redes%20neuronales/Proyecto%20base/Imagenes/PerceptronMulticapaNumeros%201.png?raw=true )|
| Prueba consolaa | A C# application that calculates the force between two electric charges using Coulomb's law. There is also a button to solve for the distance between the charges and another button to calculate the total force between three charges. Finally, there is a button to calculate the distance between two charges in a three-charge system. ![alt text]( https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/Artificial-Intelligence-Visual-Studio-.NET/blob/main/Redes%20neuronales/Proyecto%20base/Imagenes/Prueba%20consola.png?raw=true) |
| RedNeuronal_Separador_De_grupos | This project is quite similar to the perceptron color sorter, the same neural network structure is used, but this time it is planned to classify sick people. There is a database of men and women with medical data, who have a diagnosis, sick or not. They also give us data on people who have not been diagnosed, the purpose is to diagnose people without a diagnosis, developing a neural network with people who already are. It was achieved, the program returns a file with all the people classified correctly "ExamIA" and in a similar way to the color classifier it shows us the structure of the neural network in the Excel file "trainingPerceptronMen". The program also has an interface through which, after training the network, it is able to tell us if a new person is sick, entering their medical data.  ![alt text]( https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/Artificial-Intelligence-Visual-Studio-.NET/blob/main/Redes%20neuronales/Proyecto%20base/Imagenes/RedNeuronal_Separador_De_grupos.png?raw=true )   ![alt text]( https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/Artificial-Intelligence-Visual-Studio-.NET/blob/main/Redes%20neuronales/Proyecto%20base/Imagenes/RedNeuronal_Separador_De_grupos%201.png?raw=true)  ![alt text]( https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/Artificial-Intelligence-Visual-Studio-.NET/blob/main/Redes%20neuronales/Proyecto%20base/Imagenes/RedNeuronal_Separador_De_grupos%202.png?raw=true )  ![alt text]( https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/Artificial-Intelligence-Visual-Studio-.NET/blob/main/Redes%20neuronales/Proyecto%20base/Imagenes/RedNeuronal_Separador_De_grupos%203.png?raw=true ) |
| RegrecionCuadratica | In this project we approximate one line to another, through quadratic regression, we reduce the error of the ordinate to the origin and of the slope and we graph the MSE curve. ![alt text]( https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/Artificial-Intelligence-Visual-Studio-.NET/blob/main/Redes%20neuronales/Proyecto%20base/Imagenes/RegrecionCuadratica.png?raw=true) |
| SeparadorDeGrupos | This project consists of a shape classifier, depending on the position of a point within the Cartesian plane, I can distinguish between 6 figures, or colors. The classification is made by comparing the position of the point to be entered, if it is above or below with respect to the 3 lines that form the divisions. ![alt text]( https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/Artificial-Intelligence-Visual-Studio-.NET/blob/main/Redes%20neuronales/Proyecto%20base/Imagenes/SeparadorDeGrupos.png?raw=true ) ![alt text]( https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/Artificial-Intelligence-Visual-Studio-.NET/blob/main/Redes%20neuronales/Proyecto%20base/Imagenes/SeparadorDeGrupos%201.png?raw=true ) |
| Sistema en equilibrio, Con 3 cargas | This program is much simpler, it calculates the force that is exerted on a test charge due to the other three charges, you only have to give the charges and the position of the particles, the complex part of this algorithm is knowing in what position of the plane you find yourself, that's why the use of so many if conditions ![alt text](https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/Artificial-Intelligence-Visual-Studio-.NET/blob/main/Redes%20neuronales/Proyecto%20base/Imagenes/Sistema%20en%20equilibrio-Con%203%20cargas.png?raw=true ) |
